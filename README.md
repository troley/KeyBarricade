# KeyBarricade

KeyBarricade was the first bigger Java project I worked on. KeyBarricade was a school assignment which I worked on for 3 weeks to accomplish the result I wanted.

The point in this game is to get from one point in te room (spawn place) to the other point (exit, green tile) by picking up keys with ID's on them and opening barricades. The player spawns in the next level after the exit has been reached and he may continue opening barricades to get to the end of the game.

It was a great assignment to work on, especially because I learned a lot from it. For example, I learned more about inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, (Object) methods overriding, the use of enumeration classes and so forth.
